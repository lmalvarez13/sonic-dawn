# Sonic Dawn
# About this project
Sonic Dawn is my first ever approach to replicate Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega.
Initially this game was done for a 5-day Game Jam, but later on I would try and merge it with an idea from the AI Udemy Course on Unity I was doing back then, which still has to be done. Either way, the old dusty code needs to be polished before uploading it.

# Future work
As I mentioned before, my idea is to start remaking the code from scratch as well as merge it with the bosses made with AI that I already have been working on.
As part of the physics, my primary objective is to make my own physics system, since Unity's default physics cannot replicate sonic movement as it should be.
